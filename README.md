# waves-c [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wavesplatform/waves-c.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wavesplatform/waves-c)

C library for working with Waves

# Build

This package uses `cmake` 2.8+ for building and it depends on `openssl` dev package.

To build it on linux should install `openssl-dev` and just call cmake and make

```
cmake .
make
```

On Mac OS X you should [install openssl using brew](http://brewformulas.org/Openssl) and then pass the openssl path as cmake parameter:

```
brew install openssl@1.1
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1 .
make
```

For a quick start, we took the [bcdev's waves_vanity source code](https://github.com/bcdev-/waves_vanity) source code as a basis, thank bcdev for that!
